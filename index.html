            <p class="timeline-text">When the Cotton Gin was invented, thousands of Cotton workers became unemployed. This unemployment is called structural unemployment - when workers just do not have the skills for the job.

            <p class="timeline-text">While other countries had strict regulations, Britain's lassie-faire approach to technology allowed them to take an early lead in the industrial revolution. This is an example of a countries lack of worries about technology bringing them ultimate success.</p>

            <p class="timeline-text">As technological development explodes, people begin to become more and more worried about how robots and computers will affect jobs. 
              However, technology companies have only helped grow GDP and raise global welfare. Yet, income inequality has grown as production power goes to the top. Policy needs to be put in place to prevent this.</p>

            <p class="timeline-text">Prof. Vinge proposes that Artificial Intelligence will get so powerful that humans will no longer need to work. This is an idea called the singularity. Theoriticans are skeptical that this could happen. However, in the case that it does, public policy needs to be ready to adapt.</p>
